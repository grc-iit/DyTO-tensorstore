# HDF5 Driver Implementation Plan for TensorStore

This document series outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for creating an HDF5 driver for TensorStore. The implementation is divided into multiple phases, each focusing on specific aspects of the driver development.

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup and Basic Driver Implementation**
   - Basic project structure
   - Core driver interfaces
   - HDF5 integration setup

2. **Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation**
   - Metadata handling
   - Basic read/write operations
   - Schema and type conversion

3. **Phase 3: Chunking and Caching**
   - Chunk management
   - Cache implementation
   - Performance optimization

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Compression support
   - Attribute handling
   - Group support

5. **Phase 5: Testing and Documentation**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Documentation and examples

## Directory Structure

```

├── driver.h              # Main HDF5 driver class declaration
├── driver.cc            # Driver implementation
├── metadata.h           # HDF5 metadata structures
├── metadata.cc          # Metadata handling implementation

└── BUILD               # Build configuration
```

## Implementation Strategy

Each phase is broken down into specific tasks in separate markdown files:
- `01_phase1_infrastructure.md`
- `02_phase2_core_functionality.md`
- `03_phase3_chunking.md`
- `04_phase4_advanced_features.md`
- `05_phase5_testing.md`

Follow the tasks in order, as each phase builds upon the previous ones.
